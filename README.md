A Neural Network produced to optimise the use of Predictors in forecasting inflation built for the Bank of England. Unfortunately I wasn't selected.

The model uses 280 months of data to analyse how closely the previous 12 months of a predictor can predict inflation. This can be found in the Attempt_2/7-DataAnalysis where the graphs show how the model predicted compared to reality.

(Warning the audio is very poor, I did not have a working microphone and manufactured a wind muffler out of a mask)
