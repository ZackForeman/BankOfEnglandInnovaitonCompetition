Procyclinity (Fluctuation in Financial Variables) - That amplifies the procyclical impact of the banks’ own AI engines, which all have the same objective: profit maximisation subject to constraints. ‘Better’ solutions are closer to the optimum and, consequently, closer to each other.

Unknown-unknowns - One of the most challenging parts of the central bankers’ job is dealing with ‘unknown-unknowns’. Vulnerabilities, especially of the dangerous systemic type, tend to emerge on the boundaries of areas of responsibilities - the silos. Subprime mortgages put products with hidden liquidity guarantees into structured credit, crossing multiple jurisdictions, agencies, institutional categories, and countries. These are areas where humans and AI alike are least likely to look.

Current AI can easily be trained on events that have happened (‘known-knowns’). BoB can perhaps be trained on simulated scenarios (‘known-unknowns’).

Trust - BoB will likely keep the financial system safe most of the time, most likely much better than a purely human-staffed supervisory system, and we will consequently increasingly rely on and trust BoB.

Optimise against the system - The final area of concern is how BoB would deal with ‘malicious actors’: those taking unacceptably high risk, those creating instability to profit, or even those whose main objective is to damage the financial system.

Here, BoB is at a disadvantage to its opponents’ AI engines. It faces what is, in effect, an infinitely complex computational problem, as it has to monitor and control the entire system.

The opponent only has to identify local loopholes that can be exploited, and so will always have the advantage.

This advantage is amplified by AI’s intrinsic rationality. Its objectives drive its actions. It makes BoB predictable, giving its adversaries an edge. Fixed objectives paired with a complex environment create unpredictable behaviour, regardless of whether we use AI or not. Now, however, rational behaviour within a well-defined environment allows for reverse-engineering of BoB’s objectives via repeated interactions.

## Big data and machine learning in central banking

https://www.bis.org/publ/work930.pdf

Over the last decade, big data and machine learning have permeated almost all sectors of society, including economic and financial analysis. Private financial institutions have rapidly incorporated big data applications into their toolkit. Insurance companies routinely use AI to better measure client characteristics and improve their pricing schemes. Within credit institutions, applications are frequent and range from credit risk analysis to fraud detection and compliance.

A key challenge for central banks is setting up the necessary IT infrastructure. Providing adequate computing power and software, as well as training existing or hiring new staff, involves high up-front costs.

A related challenge is the legal underpinning for the use of private and confidential data. Traditionally, most data were collected and hosted within public institutions and hence readily available for analysis with clearly defined access rights.

Current banking risk management is taking care of a significant number of risks. Traditional risks like credit, liquidity, market, operational and other risks, which have been known for a long time still dominate in the worldwide risk management.

Based on our analysis, it can be seen that there is a possibility for significant AI and ML application results in the following credit risk management segments.

This set of indicators represents a supervisory rating system
to evaluate a bank's financial conditions and operations, and is widely used in the literature on
banking distress identification. The indicators are:
• Capital adequacy,
• Asset quality,
• Management,
• Earnings,
• Liquidity,
• Sensitivity to market risk,
