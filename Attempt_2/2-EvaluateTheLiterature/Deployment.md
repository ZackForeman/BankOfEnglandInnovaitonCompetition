## Machine learning in UK financial services

Firms can benefit from improved data analytics and increased operational efficiencies. These benefits can in turn aggregate to the financial system and the economy as a whole.

However, the use of ML in financial services can also amplify existing challenges and risks. Many of these challenges and risks can be traced to three underlying drivers and stages of the ML lifecycle: (i) data, (ii) models, and (iii) governance (Figure 2).

More than half of firms (52%) noted that the use of ML causes concern about potential ethical and bias issues arising. The respondents noted that these issues can have a negative impact on consumers’ ability to use products and services. This can, in turn, damage the firm’s reputation and lead to operational costs, service breakdowns, and other negative consequences. In addition, respondents highlighted outsourcing risk, which can include issues around third-party compliance with firms’ governance and data sharing frameworks.

Overall, respondents consider the top ML-related risks to be: biases in data, algorithms and outcomes (52%); data quality and structure issues (43%); lack of explainability within the model itself and the outcome (36%), which could lead to inaccurate predictions (34%) resulting in poor decisions and reputational damage (11%); inadequate controls or governance (25%); and outsourcing or third-party risks (16%).
