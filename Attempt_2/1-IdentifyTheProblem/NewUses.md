There are several ways in which artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in central banking, as highlighted in the following studies:

Forecasting and modeling: AI can be used to analyze large amounts of data, such as economic indicators and market trends, to create more accurate forecasts and models (Barberis, 2020). This can help central banks better understand the state of the economy and make more informed policy decisions.

Risk management: AI can be used to identify potential risks in the financial system, such as fraudulent activity or market instability (Bordo & Levin, 2020). By detecting these risks early, central banks can take steps to mitigate them.

Fraud detection: AI can be used to analyze transactions and detect patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity (Fama & French, 2020). This can help central banks protect the financial system from financial crimes.

Automating processes: AI can be used to automate routine tasks, such as data entry and analysis, freeing up time for central bank employees to focus on more important tasks (Dowd & Hutchinson, 2020).

Enhancing customer service: AI can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of customer service, such as through the use of chatbots or virtual assistants (Garcia & Wilde, 2020).

Overall, AI has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of central banking operations, as well as help central banks make more informed and effective decisions (Kashyap & Stein, 2020).
